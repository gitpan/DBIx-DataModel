DBIx-DataModel


DESCRIPTION

DBIx::DataModel is a wrapper framework for building Perl
abstractions (classes, objects and methods) that interact
with relational database management systems (RDBMS).  
Of course the ubiquitous DBI module is used as
a basic layer for communicating with databases; on top of that,
DBIx::DataModel provides facilities for generating SQL queries,
joining tables automatically, navigating through the results,
converting values, and building complex datastructures so that other
modules can conveniently exploit the data.
